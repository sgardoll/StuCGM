StuCGM is a driver for the Hubitat smart home hub that allows you to access your most recent blood glucose value from your CGM (via Nightscout) directly within Hubitat. This driver returns a value in mmol/L but can also return mg/dL by removing the 2 lines as indicated in the code..

This driver allows you to easily monitor your blood glucose levels in real-time and build automations based on the data. Simply add your Nightscout details into the code at the places indicated and you'll be able to access your latest readings directly from within Hubitat.



Heavily ased on the work of 'cfunk30' and the CariCGM project. More details about their driver here: https://community.hubitat.com/t/maker-api-driver-or-somthing-simple/26769/13
